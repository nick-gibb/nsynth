    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The [NSynth dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth) is a large, high-quality, and publically-available dataset of annotated musical notes. It consists of 305,979 four-second audio files with an instrument playing a note. Each musical note is annotated with the instrument family (one of the following):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | ID         |\n",
    "|-------|------------|\n",
    "| 0     | bass       |\n",
    "| 1     | brass      |\n",
    "| 2     | flute      |\n",
    "| 3     | guitar     |\n",
    "| 4     | keyboard   |\n",
    "| 5     | mallet     |\n",
    "| 6     | organ      |\n",
    "| 7     | reed       |\n",
    "| 8     | string     |\n",
    "| 9     | synth_lead |\n",
    "| 10    | vocal      |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to develop an algorithm that classifies which instrument is playing the musical note.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the non-audio JSON data from the training and test datasets was inspected and explored (note: the validation data provided in the NSynth dataset was not needed). The training data had 289,205 examples. This is far too much data to process on a standard PC. To reduce the size, 4500 samples were randomly sampled from each instrument. Instrument 9 (\"synth_lead\") was discarded because it was not present in the test dataset. Thus, the training set was reduced to 45,000 examples (10 instruments, 4500 samples from each). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, audio features were extracted. Features in the JSON annotation, such as pitch and velocity, were not considered. Instead, the Python library Librosa was used to extract audio features with more predictive power: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Harmonic or percussive](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/generated/librosa.effects.hpss.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/generated/librosa.feature.mfcc.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Mel-scaled spectrogram](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/generated/librosa.feature.melspectrogram.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chroma energy](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/generated/librosa.feature.chroma_cens.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Spectral contrast](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/generated/librosa.feature.spectral_contrast.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I have no audio engineering background and lacked sufficient time to research the technical signifiance of these features. However, I encountered other users of the NSynth dataset who found these features to be useful. In particular, [an analysis](https://github.com/NadimKawwa/NSynth) published by Github user NadimKawwa was informative and greatly accelerated this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The five audio features listed above were extracted for each of the 50,000 training examples and 4096 test examples. The instrument family (e.g. \"vocal\") was extracted from the filename of the audio clip (e.g. \"vocal_synthetic_003-092-050\"). A dataframe was then constructed using these five features and the instrument family (i.e. the target).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a random forest algorithm was trained to determine the instrument type based on audio features. Random forest is one of the most popular supervised learning algorithms. It is available in the [scikit-learn Python library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). It consists of a collection of decision trees. Each tree is different -- hence the name *random* forest. Randomness prevents overfitting, which is a common problem with decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm made 4096 predictions on the test data. In all, 2325 predictions were true and 1771 were false. The accuracy rate was thus 56.8%. Given that there are ten possible instruments, a randomly selected label would only be right 10% of the time. Thus, 56.8% is very good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extension of this work would be to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine which features were the most useful. It is possible that a similarly good result could be obtained with fewer features. This would avoid redundant computation and allow the size of the  training dataset to be expanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "All code that follows is in Python. Code is documented and explained through comments.\n",
